# Prisma HW - SImilar words service

## General notes
- Used https://github.com/ljlm0402/typescript-express-starter as starter code. I cleaned some not relevant configs but there are still leftovers. For example, I didn't touch the install packages defined in package.json
- Using NodeJs v14 + express on TypeScript
- Can run the service locally using npm and docker
- Using Swagger for API documentation, add basic documentation

## Implementation details

### Algorithm
When service starts, doing dictionary pre-processing. This improves segnificantly similar word lookup performance since it will do lookup operations in memory.
I provided (and tested) 2 different pre-processing data structures. First is based on Trie, Second is based on Map.

Insert word to dictionary operation:
- sort word alphabetically
- insert to the container (Map or Trie)
- store as value the orinal word
- values stored as an arrays of distict words as requred in `http://localhost:8000/api/v1/similar` REST API

Lookup similar words operation:
- sort word alphabetically
- lookup sorted word in the dictionary (Map or Trie)
- before returning the similar words array, remove the input word from the array (no-op if its not in the array)

Sorting word alphabetically since all similar words will have same form when sorted alphabetically, hance sorted word is used as key in the pre-processing data structures.

I described pros/cons of Map vs Trie in `src/services/similar-words.service.ts`. By default using the Map based implementation. See also performance test metrics bellow.


### Testing:

#### Unittest
Add few tests in `src/tests`. Can use `npm run tests` for running them.

#### Memory
I added memory usage log when service starts. Looks like this:
```
info: Process memory usage: {"rss":"153.93 MB -> Resident Set Size - total memory allocated for the process execution","heapTotal":"118.66 MB -> total size of the allocated heap","heapUsed":"98.41 MB -> actual memory used during the execution","external":"1.35 MB -> V8 external memory","timestamp":"2021-01-24 09:01:25"}
```

I tested both Map and Trie for the provided dictionary. Map option provided better results. Potential explanation is in `src/services/similar-words.service.ts`

Results I had (windows)
```
Map:

info: Process memory usage: 
{
  "rss":"142.03 MB -> Resident Set Size - total memory allocated for the process execution",
  "heapTotal":"117.13 MB -> total size of the allocated heap",
  "heapUsed":"87.48 MB -> actual memory used during the execution",
  "external":"1.53 MB -> V8 external memory","timestamp":"2021-01-24 10:22:32"
}


Trie:

info: Process memory usage: 
{
  "rss":"594.29 MB -> Resident Set Size - total memory allocated for the process execution",
  "heapTotal":"556.11 MB -> total size of the allocated heap",
  "heapUsed":"534.76 MB -> actual memory used during the execution",
  "external":"1.53 MB -> V8 external memory","timestamp":"2021-01-24 10:23:18"
}
```

#### Lookup performance

I used `src/pref-test.js` to run lookup tests. Basing on avarage lookup time statistic `avgProcessingTimeNs`

*NOTE:* The script is windows based, it won't work on linux, need to do import adjustments ...

The script runs 400 request using node-fetch. The request are executed using promises asynchronously.
While testing, I executed the script several times.

In general, Map preformed a bit faster. However, after execution of multiple requests, the results were close.

Would be happy to descuss the results during review. I described few related keynotes in `src/services/similar-words.service.ts`.

Results I had (windows)

```
Lookup: Running the perf-script 5 times, each time it executes 400 async requests
Map
{
  totalWords: 351075,
  totalRequests: 2000,
  avgProcessingTimeNs: 234347.70000000004
}


Trie
{
  totalWords: 351075,
  totalRequests: 2000,
  avgProcessingTimeNs: 263565.45000000007
}


Lookup: Running the perf-script once, total 400 async requests
Map:
{
  totalWords: 351075,
  totalRequests: 400,
  avgProcessingTimeNs: 229527.74999999997
}

Trie:
{
  totalWords: 351075,
  totalRequests: 400,
  avgProcessingTimeNs: 322042.74999999994
}
```


## How to run using Docker

```bash
# build
tag=prisma-prod make build

# run
tag=prisma-prod name=prisma-hw port=8000 make run
```

Verify service is running

```bash
# check the container is running
docker ps | grep prisma-hw

# check service logs
docker logs prisma-hw
```

Expected logs:
```
info: Initializing words dictionary, using file words_dictionary.txt {"timestamp":"2021-01-24 09:01:24"}
info: Initializing dictionary done {"timestamp":"2021-01-24 09:01:25"}
info: Initializing dictionary done, total number of added distinct words 351075 {"timestamp":"2021-01-24 09:01:25"}
info: Process memory usage: {"rss":"153.93 MB -> Resident Set Size - total memory allocated for the process execution","heapTotal":"118.66 MB -> total size of the allocated heap","heapUsed":"98.41 MB -> actual memory used during the execution","external":"1.35 MB -> V8 external memory","timestamp":"2021-01-24 09:01:25"}
info: ðŸš€ App listening on the port 8000 {"timestamp":"2021-01-24 09:01:25"}
```


## How to run using node, tested with NodeJs v14

```bash
# build node package
npm install

# start service in prod mode
npm run start
```

## How to check API documentation (Swagger)

Once the service is running, the API will be available in `http://localhost:8000/api-docs`

## Dictionary location

Using defalut dictionary provided in the initial email. To replace dictionary do:
- place new dictionary txt file in the `/src` dir
- set dictionary file name variable `DICTIONARY_FILE_NAME=${filename}.txt` in `.env` file
